cat-viz is an extension for Visual Studio Code that displays call graphs. It uses [cat-server](https://github.com/trettiofem/cat-server) as its back-end, which in turn is based on [CAT](https://github.com/IdrissRio/cat/), a call graph analysis tool created by [Idriss Riouak](https://github.com/IdrissRio). CAT and by extension, cat-server is built on top of the [ExtendJ](https://extendj.org/) Java compiler.
